# Lumos – AI-Powered Curriculum Intelligence

Lumos is an AI-driven tool that analyzes a **syllabus** based on a curriculum standard alongside a **student test paper**, and automatically generates a **targeted lesson plan** focused on the exact areas the student needs to improve.  
By combining curriculum-aligned analysis with AI interpretation, Lumos helps teachers deliver more precise, data-backed instruction in minutes.

✨ **Created during the Genesis AI Hackathon.**

## 🚀 What Lumos Does
- Accepts **curriculum-standard syllabi**
- Accepts **student test papers** (answers, topics missed, breakdowns)
- Uses AI to identify:
  - Learning gaps
  - Missed outcomes
  - Weak competency areas
  - Required next-step objectives
- Generates a complete **personalized lesson plan** focused on improvement areas
- Ensures all output aligns with the curriculum standard
- Uses **Gemini** as the core AI engine

## 🌟 Why Lumos Matters
Teachers often lack the time required to:
- Deeply analyze individual student performance  
- Cross-reference missed questions with curriculum outcomes  
- Build tailored lesson plans for each student  

Lumos automates this process, transforming student performance data + curriculum standards into clear, teacher-ready lesson plans — giving educators more time to teach and less time doing paperwork.

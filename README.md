## Branch Rules
 - feature/ - new features
 - fix/ - bug fixes
 - improve/ or refactor/ - to optimize

When working on a feature name branches like

## Example
```
  feature/auth-api
  fix/login-bug
  refactor/databaseLogic
```
## Commit Messages
Use commit messages like these
```
  feat: short description
  fix: short description
  improve: short description
```

## Workflow
Pull from dev branch

create your own branch (use rules above)
commit with proper format
alwasy pull before you push
make sure open Pull Request (PR) in dev branch not main
review then merge

## Notes
- Keep PRs small and focused
- Use your own feature branch dont push directly to dev or main
- Ask in Discord/whatsapp for help if unsure

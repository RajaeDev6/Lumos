Lumos – AI-Powered Curriculum Intelligence

Lumos is an AI-driven tool that analyzes a syllabus based on a curriculum standard alongside a student test paper, and automatically generates a targeted lesson plan focusing on the exact areas the student needs to improve.
By combining curriculum-aligned analysis with AI interpretation, Lumos helps teachers deliver more precise, data-backed instruction in minutes.

✨ Created during the Genesis AI Hackathon.

🌟 Why Lumos Matters

Teachers often lack the time required to:

Analyze individual student performance deeply

Cross-reference missed questions with curriculum outcomes

Build tailored lesson plans for every student

Lumos automates this tedious process.
It transforms student performance data + curriculum standards into clear, teacher-ready lesson plans — giving educators more time to teach and less time doing paperwork.
